# Markdown

##  Headers

# This is a header
## Subheader 1

New paragraphs are separated by two line breaks.

## Text emphasis

Text in italics goes between *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Text in bold goes between **two asterisks** or __two underscores__.

You can combine asterisks and underscores to **emphasize with italics and bold _at the same time_**.

1. Include a number and a dot before every item
2. Also remember to include a blank line before the beginning of the list
