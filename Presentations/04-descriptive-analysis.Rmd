Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Luiza Andrade and I am a Data Coordinator with the DIME Analytics team. 

I'm here to talk to you about creating tables in R. Although in terms of data analysis this is very similar to data visualization, in the sense that what we are doing is trying to display information about the data in the most concise and informative manner, the tools and packages required to implement the two are very different. Which is why we separated them into two sessions.

I will tell you exactly what are we going to do for the next hour and a half in a little bit, but first, let me ask you all something: what software do you usually export your tables to?

The objection of this session is to show you have to do 4 things:
- print quick statistics to explore your data
- export summary statistics tables in the most reproducible way possible
- run simple regressions
- export regression tables

I think most of you here know me already and have heard my spiel before, but since that's what I do, let's take a look at what I mean by reproducible

---

# Workflows for outputs

## .red[Not reproducible]

Anything that requires
`r fa("paste", fill = "#ac142a")` Copy-pasting
`r fa("paint-brush", fill = "#ac142a")` Manual formatting after exported

--

## .green[Reproducible]

`r fa("r-project", fill = "#046307")` R Markdown: dynamic document containing code and text that is exported directly from R into PDF, HTML, Word, Power Point and other formats 
`r fa("file-alt", fill= "#046307")` LaTeX: typesetting system used for scientific publications that automatically reloads tables and figures every time the document is rendered 

???

What is NOT reproducible? Anything that requires manual steps to update results in your final document after you update the data or the exact specification. This includes the terrible practice of printing results in the console and pasting them into Word, but also the much less terrible practice of exporting results to Excel and then manually formatting them and copying into Word.

Can someone tell me why these are not ideal practices?

The two best options to combine with R in terms of reproducibility are Markdown and LaTeX. Markdown is R's dyamic document framework and it's amazingly well developed. Most R advanced R users actually use Markdown to display their results instead of exporting tables and figures. I'm going to show you what that looks like, but this is a slightly more advanced topic that will not be covered on this course.

LaTeX, on the other hand, is widely used among non-R users, and there are plenty of packages to export tables to it in Stata as well.

But that's enough of me talking. Let's get you all to run some code

---

# Setting the stage

Load the data that we will use today: Stata's `census` dataset
```{r}
  # Load data
   census <-
    read_rds(here("DataWork",
                  "DataSets", 
                  "Final", 
                  "census.RDS"))
```

???

So first thing, as usual, is make sure you are setting your folder paths so R knows where to find files and where to export them too.

If you have already downloaded the DataWork folder from OSF, all you need to do now is edit this line of code to match your computer. I'll do it on mine in case you don't remember the exact steps.

Then we will load the packages for today: tidyverse, as usual, and two new packages: skimr and huxtable, which we will learn about soon.

Finally, let's load some data. This dataset is probably already familiar to most of you: it's Stata's built-in 1980 census data at state level.

Double-check that you can see this dataset in your environment pane. Now, can someone tell me something about this dataset and how to get a little bit of information about it?

---

# Taking a peek at the data

```{r}
glimpse(census)
```

# Setting the stage


Load the packages that we will use today
```{r, eval = F}
  # Install new packages

  install.packages("lfe")
  install.packages("huxtable")
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}

# Exploring a dataset

.command[
## `summary(x, digits)`
Equivalent to Stata's `codebook`. Its arguments are:

 * **x:** the object you want to summarize, usually a vector or data frame
 * *digits:* the number of decimal digits to be displayed
]

.exercise[

### Exercise `r fa("keyboard")`
Use the `summary()` function to describe the `census` data frame.

# Exploring a dataset

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

---

# Summarizing continuous variables

.large[
- `summary()` can also be used with a single variable.
- When used with continuous variables, it works similarly to `summarize` in Stata.
- When used with categorical variables, it works similarly to `tabulate`.
]

---

# Summarizing continuous variables

.exercise[

### Exercise `r fa("keyboard")`
Use the `summary()` function to display summary statistics for a continuous variable in the  `census` data frame.
]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_app("https://luizaandrade.shinyapps.io/learnr/")
```


---

# Summarizing categorical variables

.command[
## `table()`
Equivalent to `tabulate` in Stata, creates a frequency table. Its main arguments are vectors to be tabulated.
]

--

.exercise[
### Exercise `r fa("keyboard")`
Use the `table()` function to display frequency tables for:

1. The variable `region` in the `census` data frame
2. The variables `region` and `state` in the `census` data frame, simultaneously
]

---

# Summarizing categorical variables

## One way tabulation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_app("https://luizaandrade.shinyapps.io/learnr/")
```


---

# Summarizing continuous variables

## Two way tabulation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_app("https://luizaandrade.shinyapps.io/learnr/")
```


???

Note that the output of `table` having a single variable as argument is the same as that of `summary`. However, `table` can also do two-way tabulations

# Descriptives tables

## What if you want to...
- ...export the summary statistics to another software?
- ...customize which statistics to display?
- ...format the table?

--

## Well, then you will need to go beyond base R
- There are many packages that can be used both for displaying and exporting summary statistics
- Today we will show you a combination of two packages: `skimr` and `huxtable`
- We chose this combination because together, they can perform all the tasks we are interested in

---

# Exploring datasets with *skimr*

.large[
- The `skimr` package features are very similar to those of the functions `summary`.
- It is used to present summary statistics for a dataset.
- Like `summary`, the statistics presented vary with the class of each variable.
- `skimr`'s main function is called `skim()`, and its syntax is also very similar to `summary`.

# Exploring datasets with *skimr*


```{r, eval = FALSE}
skim(census)
```

# Exploring datasets with *skimr*


.small[
```{r, echo = F, skimr_include_summary = FALSE}
skim(census)
```
]

---

# Exploring datasets with *skimr*

.large[
The main advantage of `skimr` is that it is designed to fit well with the `tidyverse` syntax and within a data pipeline.

So, for example, if you only want to summarize a few variables, you can write the following:

```{r, eval = F}
census %>%
    skim(pop,
         popurban,
         medage,
         death,
         marriage,
         divorce)
```
]

---

# Exploring datasets with *skimr*

.small[
```{r, eval = T, echo = F, skimr_include_summary = FALSE}
census %>%
    skim(pop,
         popurban,
         medage,
         death,
         marriage,
         divorce)
```
]

---

# Customizing *skimr*

You can also create your own _skimr function list (sfl)_ for each class of variables.

```{r, eval = F}
summary_stats <-
  skim_with(numeric = sfl(Mean = mean, # Variable name = statistic
                          Median = median,
                          SD = sd,
                          Min = min,
                          Max = max),
            append = FALSE) # Remove all default statistics

census %>%
    summary_stats()
```

Here are a few functions that can be used within `sfl()`:
- Center: `mean()`, `median()`
- Spread: `sd()`, `IQR()`, `mad()`
- Range: `min()`, `max()`, `quantile()`
- Position: `first()`, `last()`, `nth()`,
- Count: `n()`, `n_distinct()`
- Logical: `any()`, `all()`

---

# Customizing *skimr*

.small[
```{r, eval = T, echo = F, skimr_include_summary = FALSE}
summary_stats <-
  skim_with(numeric = sfl(Mean = mean, # Variable name = statistic
                          Median = median,
                          SD = sd,
                          Min = min,
                          Max = max),
            append = FALSE) # Remove all default statistics

census %>%
  summary_stats()
```
]

---

# Customizing *skimr*

.small[
```{r}
census %>%
  summary_stats() %>%
  yank("numeric") %>% # keep only numeric variables on the table
  select(-n_missing, -complete_rate) # remove default statistics
```
]

---

# Exporting tables

---

# Exporting tables

To export the tables to a different software, we will need a different package, `huxtable`. The easiest way to save tables is through this family of commands:

.command[
**quick_latex(..., file)**<br>
**quick_pdf(..., file)**<br>
**quick_html(..., file)**<br>
**quick_docx(..., file)**<br>
**quick_pptx(..., file)**<br>
**quick_xlsx(..., file)**<br>
**quick_rtf(..., file)**<br>
- **...**: the huxtable objects or data frames to be exported
- *file*: the file path to where the table should be saved, including the file extension
]

---

# Exporting tables

The code below exports the table we just created to Excel and LaTeX
```{r}
# Store table so it can be exported twice
summary_stats_table <-
  census %>%
  summary_stats() %>%
  yank("numeric") %>% # keep only numeric variables on the table
  select(-n_missing, -complete_rate) # remove daulft statistics

# Export to Excel
quick_xlsx(summary_stats_table,
           file = here("DataWork",
                       "Output",
                       "Raw",
                       "summary-stats.xlsx"))

# Export to LaTeX
quick_latex(summary_stats_table,
           file = here("DataWork",
                       "Output",
                       "Raw",

# Aggregating observations

- If you want to show aggregated statistics, the function `summarise` is a powerful tool.
- It is similar to `skim` in that it calculates a series of statistics for a data frame.
- However, it does not have pre-defined statistics, so it requires more manual input.
- On the other hand, its output is a regular data frame, so it is also useful to create constructed data sets.
- Its Stata equivalent would be `collapse`

--

.command[
## `summarise(.data, ...,)`

- **data**: the data frame to be summarized
- **...**: Name-value pairs of summary functions. The name will be the name of the variable in the result.
]

--

The "name-value" pairs mentioned under `...` look like this: `new_variable = stat(existing_variable)`, where `stat` takes the same functions as `sfl`

---

# Aggregating observations

```{r}
  region_stats <-
    census %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(`Number of States` = n_distinct(state),
              `Total Population` = sum(pop))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = F}
  census %>%

# Running regressions

The base R command for linear regressions is called `lm`

.command[
## lm(formula, data, subset, weights, ...)

- **formula:**	an object of class "formula" containing a symbolic description of the model
- **data:** a data frame containing the variables indicated in the formula
- *subset:* an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the regression
- *weights:* an optional vector of weights to be used in the regression
]

Formulas can take three specifications:
- `y ~ x1 + x2` regresses variable `y` on covariates `x1` and `x2`
- `y ~ x1:x2` regresses variable `y` on the interaction of covariates `x1` and `x2`
- `y ~ x1*x2` is equivalent to `y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2`

---

# Running regressions


- The output of regression commands is a list of relevant information.
- By default, it prints only a small portion of this information.
- The best way to visualize results is to store this list in an object and then access its contents using the function `summary`

```{r}
reg1 <-
  lm(divorce ~ pop + popurban + marriage,
     census)

summary(reg1)
```

# Running regressions

The `lfe` command `felm` allows for more flexibility in model specification

.command[
## felm(formula, data, subset, weights, ...)

- **formula:**	an object of class "formula" containing a symbolic description of the model
- **data:** a data frame containing the variables indicated in the formula
- *subset:* an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the regression
- *weights:* an optional vector of weights to be used in the regression
]

Formulas for `felm` are more complex, and take the following format:
`y ~ x1 + x2 | fe1 + fe2 | (Q|W ~ iv3+iv4) | clu1 + clu2`
- `y ~ x1 + x2` takes all the same formulas as `lm`
- `fe1 + fe2` list the variables to be included as fixed effects
- `(Q|W ~ iv3 + iv4)` uses instruments `iv3` and `iv4` for variables `Q` and `W`
- ` clu1 + clu2` indicates that standard errors should be clustered using variables `clu1` and `clu2`

# Some notes on regressions

.large[
- Whenever a factor is included in the list of covariates, it is treated as a categorical variable, i.e., as if you had written `i.x` in Stata.
- Whenever a boolean is included in the list of covariates, it is treated as a dummy variable, where `TRUE` is `1` and `FALSE` is `0`.
- `felm` also allows for bootstrapping, but this is beyong the scope of this session.

`huxtable` also has a quick wrapper for regression tables

.command[
## huxreg(...)
- **...**: Models, or a single list of models. Names will be used as column headings.
- *number_format:* Format for numbering. See number_format() for details.
- *stars:* Levels for p value stars.
- *bold_signif:* Where p values are below this number, cells will be displayed in bold.
- *note:* Footnote for bottom cell, which spans all columns.
- *statistics:* A vector of summary statistics to display.
- *coefs:* A vector of coefficients to display. To change display names, name the coef vector: c("Displayed title" = "coefficient_name", ...)

# Exporting regression tables

.small[
```{r}
huxreg(reg1, reg2)
```
