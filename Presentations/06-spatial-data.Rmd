# Introduction

There are two main types of spatial data: vector and raster data. 

--

- **Raster:** spatially-referenced grids where each cell has one value.

--

- **Vectors or shapefiles:** spatial-referenced objects consisting of points, lines and polygons. These shapes are attached to a dataframe, where each row corresponds to a different spatial element.

# Introduction

- This session could be a whole course on its own, but we only have an hour and half.
- To narrow our subject, we will focus on only one type of spatial data, shapefiles. 
- This is the most common type of spatial data that non-GIS experts will encounter in their work.
- We will focus mostly on how to visualize spatial data, although we will also cover some simple geometry operations.
- We will use the `sf` package, which is the tidyverse-compatible package for geospatial data in R.
- If you want to know more about geospatial data in R, we recommend the book [https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/](Geocomputation with R), by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow.

# Loading a shapefile with sf

The first thing we will do in this session is to recreate this data set:

```{r}
worldmap <- 
  st_read(here("DataWork",
               "DataSets",
               "Final",
               "worldmap.shp"))
```

```{r, eval = F}
plot(worldmap)
```

---

# Exploring the data

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = F}
plot(worldmap)
```

---

# Loading spatial data

Load a built-in map using the `rworldmap` package

```{r}
worldmap <- getMap(resolution="low")
```

Look at the data structure
```{r, eval = F}
View(worldmap)
```

This object is a list with three main components:
- Data
- Polygons
- Projection

# Spatial data structure: the data

- The data portion of a shapefile is a data frame like any other in R.
- To access it, we need to refer to the data element in our list by typing `objectname@data`.

# Spatial data structure: projection

__Coordinate reference systems__ map pairs of numbers to a location.

* __Geographic Coordinate Systems__ live on a sphere; here, the units are in decimal degrees (latitude = angle from equator; longitude = angle from prime meridian)

    + Using the WGS84 coordinate system the World Bank MC building is located at 38.89 degrees latitude and -77.04 degrees longitude.

--

* __Projected Coordinate Systems__ project the earth onto a flat surface (units here are typically in meters from some reference point). 

    + Using to the World Mercator projection, the World Bank is located 4680364.64 meters north and -8576320.73 meters east.
    
```{r fig.align="center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/coordinate_systems.jpg", dpi = 220)
```

---

# Spatial data structure: projection

Projecting the earth onto a flat surface distorts [distorts](http://geoawesomeness.com/5-tools-will-let-master-map-projections/) the earth in some way (shape, area, distance or direction).

> Projections are also the main source of error when plotting spatial data: if two spatial objects have different reference systems, plotting them together will result in quite weird maps

# Combining non-spatial and spatial data

- To create the `worldmap` shapefile that you have in your final data folder, we combined the data in `whr_panel` and the polygon in `worldmap`. Given what we have seen, this is as simple as joining two data sets

--

We need to make a few adjustment to the data so the join works:
.small[
```{r}
worldmap <-
  worldmap %>%
  mutate(country = as.character(ADMIN),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "United States of America", "United States"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "Northern Cyprus", "North Cyprus"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "Hong Kong S.A.R.", "Hong Kong"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "Republic of Serbia", "Serbia"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "Somaliland", "Somaliland Region"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "West Bank", "Palestinian Territories"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Congo (Kinshasa)"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "Republic of the Congo", "Congo (Brazzaville)"),
         country = str_replace_all(country, "United Republic of Tanzania", "Tanzania"))

whr_panel <-
  whr_panel %>% 
  filter(year == 2015)
```
]

Then we can join them:
.small[
```{r}
worldmap <-
  worldmap %>%
  left_join(whr_panel)
```
]

# Visualizing polygons

- `ggplot` has a special geometry for `sf`: `geom_sf`

ggplot(worldmap) +

  coord_quickmap() + # Correct distortion #<<

```

---

# Adding a basemap

The package `ggmap` allows us to layers as a basemap. The code is the same as `ggplot`, except here we start the code with `ggmap()` instead of `gplot()`.


Here is how we can retrieve basemaps:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = F}
# Create an object with Africa only
africa <-
  worldmap %>%
  filter(REGION == "Africa")
  
# Calculate which part of the world we want images for
# (this is called a bounding box)
africa_box <- 
  st_bbox(africa) 

# Save the basemap
africa_basemap <- 
  get_stamenmap(as.vector(africa_box),
                zoom = 3, # The higher the zoom, the more details you get
                maptype = "watercolor")
```

---

# Adding a basemap


```{r}
ggmap(africa_basemap)
```

---

# Customizing basemaps

`r fa("map-marked-alt",  fill = "#D38C28")` You can also use other image sources than Stamen Maps with the `get_map` function:
- Google Maps (`"google"`), OpenStreetMap (`"osm"`), Stamen Maps (`"stamen"`)

--

`r fa("layer-group",  fill = "#D38C28")` Here are a few other map types you can use with `get_stamenmap`:
- `"terrain"`, `"terrain-background"`, `"terrain-labels"`, `"terrain-lines"`, `"toner"`,
  `"toner-2010"`, `"toner-2011"`, `"toner-background"`, `"toner-hybrid"`,
  `"toner-labels"`, `"toner-lines"`, `"toner-lite"`, `"watercolor"`)

--

`r fa("paint-brush",  fill = "#D38C28")` Finally, you can use the options `color` and `alpha` to change from black and white to color and increase transparency 
of the basemap.

---

# Adding layers on top of a basemap

```{r, eval = F}
ggmap(africa_basemap) + 
   geom_point(data = wb_projects,
              aes(x=longitude,
                  y=latitude),
              size = .1) +
  theme_void()
```

> Note that with `ggmap` we don't need the option `coord_quickmap`

---

# Adding layers on top of a basemap

```{r, echo = F}
ggmap(africa_basemap) + 
   geom_point(data = wb_projects,
              aes(x=longitude,
                  y=latitude),
              size = .1) +
  theme_void()
```

---

# Combining our two maps

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot() +

  geom_point(data = wb_projects,
              aes(x = longitude,
                  y = latitude),
              size = .1) +
  labs(fill="Happiness\nScore") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue",
                        high = "yellow") +
  theme_void()

# Transforming GPS data into a shapefile

- As we saw earlier, shapefiles can contain points, polygons or lines.
- So far, we have only use the `wb_projects` coordinates as if they were numbers like any others.
- To be able to change the projection of `wb_projects`, we need to convert it into a spatial object.

Here's some pseudo code:

```{r, eval = F}
# 1 Create a polygon of Mozambique by subsetting the worldmap sf
# 2 Make sure the Moz polygon and the wb_projects shapefile have the same projection

# 4 Create a map with the resulting data and customize as you like
